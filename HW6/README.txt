Original 2 bits

C=110
G=1110

As Huffman Code A:50% T:35% C:10% G:5%
A = 0
T = 10
C = 110
G = 1110

100% as original with 2 bits

50% A as 2 bits - 50 * 0.5(1bit) =  25%

35% T as 2 bits - 35 * 1(2bits) =   35%

10% C as 2 bits - 10 * 1.5(3bits) = 15%

5%  G as 2 bits - 5 * 2(4bits) =    10%
                                   —————
25% + 52.5% + 15% + 7.5% =          85% of original size

compression ratio = 100:85 or 1.17
